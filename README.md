# High Performance High Time Resolution Logger C++

`Quant::Diagnostics::TLogger` is a C++ class that is a super fast logger that allows an app to log its activities to a file. It captures and formats log record date-time-stamps in 100 nanoseconds resolution.

This is a Visual Studio solution that builds on both Linux and Windows.

I developed this for a client of mine in May 2019, but, unfortunately, the client has died before they got a chance to pay me. So I am not making anyone's intellectual property public here.
